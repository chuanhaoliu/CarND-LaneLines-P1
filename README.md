# **Project: Finding Lane Lines on the Road**
Overview
- - -
In this project, our target is to identify lane lines on the road. The pipeline is developed on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream, by using Python and OpenCV. The code and processes is writen in Jupyter Notebook, and the writeup file can provide a detailed response to the "Reflection" section of the Udacity project requirement.
There are only four file in this project, as the following list shows. Actually if you want to run the code written in Jupyter Notebook, you need the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) to setup the environment.
* Jupyter Notebook
* HTML
* WRITEUP.md
* README.md
